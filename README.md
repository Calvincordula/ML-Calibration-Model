# Machine Learning Calibration Model

A Machine Learning calibration model for correcting low-cost PM2.5 sensor data, enhancing measurement accuracy for air quality and atmospheric studies.

- Applied design science research methodology to develop a calibration model using XGBoost and Random Forest.
- Achieved a 40% reduction in measurement error by comparing low-cost sensor data with reference-grade monitors, enabling reliable air quality mapping.
